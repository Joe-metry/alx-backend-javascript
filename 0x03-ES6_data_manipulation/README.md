				ES6_data_manipulation:
				----------------------


ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced several features for data manipulation in JavaScript, making code more concise and expressive. Some key features include:

1. **Arrow Functions**: Shorter syntax for defining functions, making them more concise.

2. **Template Literals**: Easier string interpolation and multiline strings using backticks (`).

3. **Destructuring**: Easily extract values from arrays and objects into variables.

4. **Spread and Rest Operators**: Spread (`...`) for unpacking elements of an array or object, and Rest (`...`) for collecting elements into an array.

5. **Array Methods**: ES6 added new array methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `forEach` for more efficient and expressive data manipulation.

6. **Classes**: Introduced the `class` keyword for creating classes, improving object-oriented programming.

7. **Let and Const**: `let` and `const` for block-scoped variable declarations, reducing the risk of unintended variable changes.

8. **Promises**: A built-in mechanism for handling asynchronous operations, simplifying asynchronous code.

9. **Modules**: ES6 introduced a standardized module system using `import` and `export` for better code organization and reusability.

These ES6 features have significantly improved the readability and maintainability of JavaScript code, making data manipulation and overall programming more efficient and enjoyable.
