		Project Overview:
		-----------------


1. **Asynchronous Operations**: Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript more cleanly and predictably.

2. **States**: Promises have three states: 
   - **Pending**: Initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
   - **Fulfilled (Resolved)**: The operation completed successfully, and a result is available.
   - **Rejected**: The operation encountered an error or was unsuccessful, and an error reason is provided.

3. **Syntax**: Promises are created using the `Promise` constructor, which takes a function with two parameters, `resolve` and `reject`.

   ```javascript
   const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
     // Asynchronous code
     if (success) {
       resolve(result);
     } else {
       reject(error);
     }
   });
   ```

4. **Chaining**: Promises can be chained together using `.then()` to handle success and `.catch()` to handle errors. This allows for more readable and sequential code.

   ```javascript
   promise
     .then(result => {
       // Handle success
     })
     .catch(error => {
       // Handle error
     });
   ```

5. **Promise.all()**: Combines multiple promises and resolves when all of them have resolved, providing an array of results.

   ```javascript
   const promises = [promise1, promise2, promise3];
   Promise.all(promises)
     .then(results => {
       // Handle all resolved promises
     })
     .catch(error => {
       // Handle any error
     });
   ```

6. **Promise.race()**: Resolves as soon as one of the promises in an array is resolved or rejected.

   ```javascript
   const promises = [promise1, promise2, promise3];
   Promise.race(promises)
     .then(result => {
       // Handle the first resolved promise
     })
     .catch(error => {
       // Handle any error
     });
   ```

ES6 Promises simplify working with asynchronous code, making it more readable and maintainable. They have become a fundamental part of modern JavaScript development, especially for tasks like data fetching and API requests.
