		Project Overview:
		-----------------

ES6, or ECMAScript 2015, is a significant update to the JavaScript programming language, introducing many new features and improvements. Here's a brief overview of some ES6 basics:

1. **`let` and `const` Declarations**: ES6 introduced `let` and `const` for variable declarations. `let` is block-scoped, while `const` creates constants. These help improve variable scoping and reduce bugs.

   ```javascript
   let variableName = 'value';
   const constantValue = 42;
   ```

2. **Arrow Functions**: Arrow functions provide a more concise way to write functions, especially for one-liners. They also capture the surrounding `this` value.

   ```javascript
   const add = (a, b) => a + b;
   ```

3. **Template Literals**: Template literals allow you to create multi-line strings and interpolate variables within them using `${}`.

   ```javascript
   const name = 'John';
   console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
   ```

4. **Default Parameters**: You can set default values for function parameters, making it more convenient to work with optional arguments.

   ```javascript
   function greet(name = 'Guest') {
     console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
   }
   ```

5. **Rest and Spread Operators**: The rest (`...`) and spread (`...`) operators are useful for working with variable-length argument lists and arrays.

   ```javascript
   function sum(...numbers) {
     return numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
   }

   const array1 = [1, 2, 3];
   const array2 = [4, 5, 6];
   const combinedArray = [...array1, ...array2];
   ```

6. **Destructuring Assignment**: Destructuring allows you to extract values from objects and arrays easily.

   ```javascript
   const { firstName, lastName } = user;
   const [first, second] = someArray;
   ```

7. **Classes**: ES6 introduced a more structured way to create and work with classes and objects using the `class` syntax.

   ```javascript
   class Person {
     constructor(name) {
       this.name = name;
     }

     sayHello() {
       console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);
     }
   }
   ```

8. **Modules**: ES6 introduced a module system that enables better code organization and reuse. You can export and import functions, classes, or values between different modules.

   ```javascript
   // Exporting in one module
   export function someFunction() { /* ... */ }

   // Importing in another module
   import { someFunction } from './otherModule.js';
   ```

9. **Promises**: Promises provide a cleaner way to work with asynchronous operations, making it easier to handle success and error cases.

   ```javascript
   const fetchData = () => {
     return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
       // Async operation
       if (success) {
         resolve(data);
       } else {
         reject(error);
       }
     });
   };
   ```

10. **Object Enhancements**: ES6 introduced shorthand syntax for defining object properties and methods within object literals.

    ```javascript
    const name = 'John';
    const age = 30;
    const person = { name, age };
    ```

These are just some of the key features introduced in ES6. ES6 greatly improved the readability and maintainability of JavaScript code, making it a more powerful and modern language for web development. Subsequent versions of JavaScript have continued to build upon these enhancements.
